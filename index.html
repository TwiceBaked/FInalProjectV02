    <h1>Gabe Carlson's Final Project Proposal </h1>
    <h1>Code Name: DigitalTerracotta</h1>
    <h2>
        Have you ever wanted to play a quick game of risk, but dread the lengthy battles due to the endless dice rolling? 
        Dread no more! DigitalTerracotta does the rolling for you! 
        You will be able to enter the number of units attacking and defending. 
        You will be able to simulate the entire battle or play out each indivddual roll. 
        This program will be coded with Python and NOT hosted on Azure.

        Originally I planned for a turtle draw progam that created a specific pattern in a a random fasion. But I soon changed it to the 
        Risk Dice rolling simulator it is today. I planned for this program to take the number of attacking and defending units and simulate
        the the battle to see who wins. It would do this by asking for an input for both types of units. Then the program would ask how you 
        want the battle to be simulate: either roll by roll or the entire battle at once. Then the battle would be simulated and a winner declared.
        I was able to fully implement everything that I planned for this project. I would like to add a pop up window so that I could add some art
        and visual represention of what the program was doing. I know we did not learn how to do that in this class but I think it would greatly 
        improve the user experience.
