    <h1>Gabe Carlson's Final Project Proposal </h1>
    <h1>Code Name: DigitalTerracotta</h1>
    <h2>
        Have you ever wanted to play a quick game of risk, but dread the lengthy battles due to the endless dice rolling? 
        Dread no more! DigitalTerracotta does the rolling for you! 
        You will be able to enter the number of units attacking and defending. 
        You will be able to simulate the entire battle or play out each indivddual roll. 
        This program will be coded with Python and NOT hosted on Azure.
